            The human brain is the central information processing organ of the
            body and acts as the command center for coordinating all voluntary
            and involuntary activities. It is derived from the embryonic
            ectoderm and is protected by the
            <span>cranial bones (cranium)</span>, <span>meninges</span>, and
            <span>cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The brain is covered by three connective tissue membranes
            collectively called <span>meninges</span>: the
            <span>outer dura mater</span>, the <span>middle arachnoid</span>,
            and the <span>inner pia mater</span>. The space between the
            arachnoid and pia mater is filled with
            <span>cerebrospinal fluid</span>, which acts as a cushion, provides
            nourishment, and protects the brain from mechanical shocks.
          </p>

          <p>
            The human brain is broadly divided into three main regions: the
            <span>forebrain</span>, <span>midbrain</span>, and
            <span>hindbrain</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>forebrain</span> is the most complex and largest part of
            the brain. It consists of three major structures: the
            <span>cerebrum</span>, <span>thalamus</span>, and
            <span>hypothalamus</span>. The cerebrum is divided into two
            hemispheres connected by a bundle of nerve fibers called the
            <span>corpus callosum</span>. Each hemisphere is further divided
            into four lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>surface of the cerebrum</span> is highly folded,
            increasing surface area for neuron accommodation. It is the site of
            various higher mental functions such as thinking, intelligence,
            memory, speech, and voluntary motor activities. Sensory and motor
            areas are located in specific regions of the cerebrum.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beneath the cerebrum lies the <span>thalamus</span>, a major
            coordinating center for sensory and motor signaling. Below the
            thalamus is the <span>hypothalamus</span>, which plays a vital role
            in regulation of
            <span
              >body temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep, emotions, and endocrine
              activity</span
            >. It also controls the <span>pituitary gland</span>, linking the
            nervous and endocrine systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>midbrain</span> lies between the thalamus/hypothalamus of
            the forebrain and the pons of the hindbrain. It contains four small
            lobes called the <span>corpora quadrigemina</span>. The midbrain is
            associated with <span>visual and auditory reflexes</span> and also
            contains motor and sensory pathways.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>hindbrain</span> consists of three major parts: the
            <span>pons</span>, the <span>cerebellum</span>, and the
            <span>medulla oblongata</span>. The pons acts as a bridge between
            various parts of the nervous system and also contains centers for
            respiration. The cerebellum is responsible for
            <span
              >maintaining posture, balance, and coordination of body
              movements</span
            >. The medulla oblongata controls
            <span>involuntary functions</span> such as heartbeat, breathing,
            swallowing, and vomiting.
          </p>

          <p>
            The brain has cavities called <span>ventricles</span> which are
            filled with <span>cerebrospinal fluid</span>. This fluid also flows
            in the central canal of the spinal cord and performs functions like
            cushioning the brain, maintaining pressure, and removing waste
            substances.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, the human brain is a highly specialized and structurally
            organized organ that controls and integrates all major functions of
            the body, including
            <span
              >voluntary actions, reflexes, emotional responses, memory, and
              learning</span
            >.

          <p>
            The human brain functions as the
            <span>control and command center</span> of the body. It receives
            sensory input, processes the information, interprets it, and
            coordinates appropriate responses by sending out motor signals. It
            also governs complex processes such as memory, emotions, reasoning,
            and learning.
          </p>

          <p>
            All incoming information from the body’s sense organs is first
            transmitted to the brain via <span>sensory neurons</span>. These
            impulses are interpreted mainly in the <span>cerebrum</span>, where
            conscious perception, decision-making, and voluntary actions take
            place. The <span>motor areas</span> of the cerebrum then send
            signals to the relevant muscles or organs via
            <span>motor neurons</span> to bring about the required action.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>cerebral cortex</span>, the outermost layer of the
            cerebrum, is involved in <span>higher functions</span> like
            consciousness, intelligence, memory, language, and judgment. The
            sensory areas receive signals (e.g., visual from eyes, auditory from
            ears), the association areas process and interpret them, and the
            motor areas plan and execute responses.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>thalamus</span> acts as a relay center, channeling sensory
            impulses from the body to the appropriate areas of the cerebrum. It
            plays a key role in <span>awareness and attention</span>. The
            <span>hypothalamus</span> regulates various
            <span>homeostatic mechanisms</span> such as body temperature,
            hunger, thirst, sleep cycles, and emotions. It also controls the
            release of hormones by regulating the <span>pituitary gland</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>midbrain</span> plays a significant role in controlling
            <span>reflex movements</span> related to vision and hearing. It
            helps process auditory and visual information and initiates quick
            responses such as turning your head towards a sound.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>cerebellum</span> of the hindbrain is responsible for
            <span>maintaining balance, posture, and coordination</span> of
            voluntary movements. Although it doesn’t initiate movement, it
            ensures smooth and precise muscle activity by fine-tuning motor
            commands sent from the cerebrum.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>medulla oblongata</span> controls
            <span>vital involuntary functions</span> like heartbeat,
            respiration, blood pressure, salivation, and vomiting. Damage to the
            medulla can be fatal as it governs basic survival functions.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>pons</span> works as a relay station between different
            parts of the brain, especially between the cerebellum and cerebrum.
            It also contains centers that assist in regulating
            <span>respiratory rhythm</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The brain functions through a vast network of neurons that
            communicate via <span>electrochemical signals</span>. The
            <span>synaptic transmission</span> between neurons enables fast and
            efficient information transfer. Neurons do not regenerate easily,
            making the brain highly sensitive to injury or disease.
          </p>

          <p>
            Apart from voluntary actions, the brain also controls
            <span>involuntary actions and reflexes</span>. Many of these are
            handled by the <span>autonomic nervous system</span>, but the brain
            integrates the sensory inputs and outputs for coordination.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, the brain’s working is characterized by
            <span>coordination, integration, and regulation</span> of all body
            functions — both voluntary and involuntary — ensuring survival and
            enabling complex mental activities that define human intelligence
            and behavior.
