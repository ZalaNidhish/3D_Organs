          <p>
            The <span>human heart</span> is a mesodermally derived organ located
            in the mediastinum of the thoracic cavity, slightly tilted towards
            the left. It is a
            <span>muscular, four-chambered, hollow organ</span> roughly the size
            of a closed fist. Its primary function is to circulate blood
            throughout the body and lungs.
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart is enclosed in a
            <span>double-layered membranous sac</span> called the
            <span>pericardium</span>. The outer layer is fibrous, while the
            inner layer is serous and secretes <span>pericardial fluid</span>.
            This fluid acts as a lubricant and reduces friction during
            heartbeats.
          </p>

          <p>
            Internally, the heart is divided into four chambers: two
            <span>atria (auricles)</span> on the upper side and two
            <span>ventricles</span> on the lower side. The atria are
            thin-walled, while the ventricles have thick muscular walls, with
            the <span>left ventricle being the thickest</span> to withstand high
            pressure and pump blood to the entire body.
          </p>

          <p>
            The right and left halves of the heart are separated by a thick wall
            called the <span>septum</span>. The septum between the atria is the
            <span>interatrial septum</span>, and the one between the ventricles
            is the <span>interventricular septum</span>. The atria and
            ventricles on each side are separated by the
            <span>atrioventricular septum</span>, which contains valves to
            prevent backflow of blood.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>right atrium</span> receives deoxygenated blood from the
            body via two large veins: the <span>superior vena cava</span> and
            the <span>inferior vena cava</span>. It also receives blood from the
            heart wall through the <span>coronary sinus</span>. The
            <span>left atrium</span> receives oxygenated blood from the lungs
            through four <span>pulmonary veins</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the right atrium, blood flows into the
            <span>right ventricle</span> through the
            <span>tricuspid valve</span>, a valve with three cusps. Blood from
            the left atrium flows into the <span>left ventricle</span> through
            the <span>bicuspid valve</span> (also known as the mitral valve),
            which has two cusps. These
            <span>atrioventricular valves</span> prevent the backflow of blood
            into the atria during ventricular contraction.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <span>right ventricle</span> pumps blood into the
            <span>pulmonary artery</span> through a
            <span>semilunar valve</span>, sending it to the lungs for
            oxygenation. The <span>left ventricle</span> pumps oxygenated blood
            into the <span>aorta</span> through another semilunar valve to
            distribute it throughout the body. These
            <span>semilunar valves</span> also prevent backflow into the
            ventricles.
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart's muscular wall is made of a specialized type of muscle
            tissue called <span>cardiac muscle</span>, which is involuntary,
            striated, and capable of rhythmic contractions. The wall has three
            layers: the inner <span>endocardium</span>, the middle thick
            <span>myocardium</span>, and the outer <span>epicardium</span>.
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart functions as a <span>double pump</span>. The right side of
            the heart handles <span>pulmonary circulation</span>, pumping
            deoxygenated blood to the lungs, while the left side manages
            <span>systemic circulation</span>, pumping oxygenated blood to the
            body. This results in a <span>complete double circulation</span>,
            which is a characteristic feature of birds and mammals, ensuring
            separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
          </p>

          <p>
            The opening and closing of heart valves and the rhythmic contraction
            and relaxation of heart chambers ensure unidirectional flow of
            blood. This coordinated functioning is vital for efficient
            circulation and is regulated by the
            <span>conducting system of the heart</span>, including the
            <span>Sinoatrial (SA) node</span>,
            <span>Atrioventricular (AV) node</span>, <span>Bundle of His</span>,
            and <span>Purkinje fibers</span>. Though this system is mainly
            discussed under heartbeat, its structural elements are embedded in
            the heart tissue.

        <div class="theory">
          <p>
            The functioning of the heart involves a sequential and rhythmic
            contraction and relaxation of the atria and ventricles to ensure
            <span>continuous, unidirectional flow of blood</span>. This rhythmic
            contraction is known as the <span>cardiac cycle</span>, which occurs
            once every heartbeat and lasts approximately 0.8 seconds.
          </p>

          <p>
            A single cardiac cycle consists of three main phases:
            <span>atrial systole</span>, <span>ventricular systole</span>, and
            <span>joint diastole</span>. During atrial systole, the atria
            contract and pump blood into the ventricles. This is followed by
            ventricular systole, in which the ventricles contract and pump blood
            into the pulmonary artery and aorta. Finally, in joint diastole,
            both the atria and ventricles relax, allowing blood to enter the
            atria again.
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart's rhythmic activity is initiated and regulated by the
            <span>nodal tissue</span>, which includes the
            <span>Sinoatrial (SA) node</span>,
            <span>Atrioventricular (AV) node</span>, <span>Bundle of His</span>,
            and <span>Purkinje fibers</span>. The SA node, located in the right
            atrium, is called the <span>pacemaker</span> of the heart because it
            generates the maximum number of action potentials, typically about
            70â€“75 per minute.
          </p>

          <p>
            The electrical impulse generated by the SA node spreads over the
            atria, causing them to contract. It then reaches the AV node, which
            is located between the atria and ventricles. The AV node passes the
            impulse to the ventricles via the
            <span>AV bundle (Bundle of His)</span>, which branches into the
            <span>right and left bundle branches</span> and then into
            <span>Purkinje fibers</span> that stimulate ventricular contraction.
          </p>

          <p>
            This conduction pathway ensures that the
            <span
              >atria contract a fraction of a second before the ventricles</span
            >, allowing complete filling of ventricles before they contract.
            This coordination maintains the
            <span>efficiency of blood circulation</span> and prevents mixing of
            oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart sounds heard during auscultation are produced due to the
            <span>closure of valves</span>. The first heart sound "lub" is
            caused by the <span>closure of the atrioventricular valves</span> at
            the beginning of ventricular systole. The second heart sound "dub"
            is produced by the <span>closure of the semilunar valves</span> at
            the beginning of ventricular diastole.
          </p>

          <p>
            The amount of blood pumped by each ventricle per minute is called
            <span>cardiac output</span>. In a healthy adult, the average cardiac
            output is approximately <span>5000 mL (5 litres) per minute</span>.
            It is the product of the heart rate and stroke volume (the amount of
            blood pumped per beat).
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart's activity is <span>myogenic</span> in nature, meaning it
            originates from the cardiac muscles themselves and is not dependent
            on nervous stimuli. However, the
            <span>autonomic nervous system (ANS)</span> modulates the rate and
            force of heartbeat. The sympathetic system increases heart rate and
            cardiac output, while the parasympathetic (vagus nerve) decreases
            it.
          </p>

          <p>
            The heart is also influenced by hormones such as
            <span>adrenaline and noradrenaline</span>, which increase heart rate
            during stress or emergency situations, allowing the body to respond
            more effectively.
